# Matrix Generation Process

This document provides a concise guide for generating the coverage matrix for Stencil decorators. It outlines the iterative process for maintaining comprehensive coverage as the codebase evolves.

## Process Overview

1. **Enumerate Permutations:** List all possible decorator permutations and options.
2. **Scan for Coverage:** Identify which permutations are already covered by existing components/tests.
3. **Generate Missing Cases:** Create new components/tests for uncovered permutations.
4. **Update Matrix:** Revise the matrix and documentation after each iteration.

Best practices and lessons learned from previous cycles are captured here. For verification steps, see `verification.mdx`.
