# Matrix Verification Process

This file provides a concise guide for verifying the coverage matrix. The process is iterative and currently performed manually, but may be automated in the future.

1. **Sample Components:** Randomly select generated components (manual process for now; automation may be added).
2. **Mutate Decorators:** Programmatically change decorator values.
3. **Rerun Coverage Script:** Check if the matrix/report reflects changes.
4. **Validate Reliability:** Repeat to ensure consistent accuracy.

These steps ensure the matrix remains a trustworthy source of truth. For generation steps, see `generation.mdx`.
