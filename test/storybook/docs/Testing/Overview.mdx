# Testing in the Stencil Project

Stencil uses two main categories of tests to ensure code quality and reliability:

- **Core Testing:** Located under the `src` folder, these tests directly validate Stencil's source code, core logic, and internals. See `core-testing.mdx` for a detailed breakdown.

- **Integration & E2E Testing:** Located under the `test` folder, these tests validate Stencil as a dependency, focusing on integration, end-to-end scenarios, and user-facing features. See `integration-e2e-testing.mdx` for a detailed breakdown.

For more details on each category, refer to:
- [Core Testing Documentation](./Core.mdx)
- [Integration & E2E Testing Documentation](./integration-e2e.mdx)

This overview will be updated as new tests and documentation are added.
