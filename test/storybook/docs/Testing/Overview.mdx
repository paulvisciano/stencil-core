# Testing in the Stencil Project

Stencil uses two main categories of tests to ensure code quality and reliability:

- **Core Testing:** Located under the `src` folder, these tests directly validate Stencil's source code, core logic, and internals. See `core-testing.mdx` for a detailed breakdown.

- **Integration & E2E Testing:** Located under the `test` folder, these tests validate Stencil as a dependency, focusing on integration, end-to-end scenarios, and user-facing features. See `integration-e2e-testing.mdx` for a detailed breakdown.

- **Decorator Test Coverage:** This section provides detailed test coverage matrices for Stencil's decorators, ensuring that all permutations of decorator options are tested.

For more details on each category, refer to:
- [Core Testing Documentation](./Core.mdx)
- [Integration & E2E Testing Documentation](./Integration-e2e.mdx)
- [Decorator Test Coverage](./Decorators/Overview.mdx)

This overview will be updated as new tests and documentation are added.
