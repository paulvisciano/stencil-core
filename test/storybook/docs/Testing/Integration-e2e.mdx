# Integration & E2E Testing in the Stencil Project

This document covers all **integration and end-to-end (E2E)** tests for Stencil, which are located under the `test` folder. These tests validate Stencil from the outside by importing it as a dependency, simulating real-world usage, and testing integration, E2E scenarios, and feature behaviors. They are loosely coupled and focus on user-facing features, build outputs, and application-level scenarios.

## Test Groupings & Purpose

### 1. Sample Apps & Demos
- Example Stencil apps and usage demos.
  - `hello-world`, `hello-vdom`, `todo-app`, `ionic-app`, `storybook`

### 2. Feature/Functionality-Specific Tests
- Tests focused on specific Stencil features or outputs.
  - `docs-json`, `docs-readme`, `copy-task`, `style-modes`, `browser-compile`, `bundler`, `performance`, `prerender-shadow`, `type-tests`

### 3. Integration & E2E Test Suites
- Automated E2E and integration test suites.
  - `end-to-end`, `wdio`

### 4. Infrastructure & Utilities
- Test/build support scripts and runners.
  - `.scripts`, `jest-spec-runner`

## Test Types
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate real user scenarios, browser interactions, and full builds.
- **Feature-Specific Tests:** Target specific Stencil features, optimizations, or edge cases.
- **Performance Tests:** Measure and validate build/runtime performance.
- **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between Stencil and external systems or user projects.

## How to Add or Run Tests
- **E2E/Wdio:** Use WebdriverIO for browser-based tests. See `test/wdio/README.md` for setup and commands.
- **Feature/Performance:** Refer to the respective folder's README or config files for instructions.

For more details, see individual test files and folder READMEs.
